# Hospital Management System  

This project is a web-based Hospital Management System developed as part of the **Database System (CO2013)** course. It provides functionality for managing patient data, doctor assignments, and treatment payment records. The database design is supported by an **Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram (EERD)** and **Relational Schema**, included as accompanying files.
